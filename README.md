## soco.py

SoCo (Sonos Controller) is a simple Python class that allows you to programmatically control [Sonos speakers](http://www.sonos.com/system/). It was created at [Music Hack Day Sydney](http://sydney.musichackday.org/2012/), so there is still much room for improvement, however the basic control functionality is there and works well. I've tested it with both a Play:3 and a Play:5.

For more background on this project, please see my [related blog post](http://www.hirahim.com/blog/2012/04/29/dissecting-the-sonos-controller/).
